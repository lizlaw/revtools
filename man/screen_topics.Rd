\title{Shiny app for screening bibliographies using topic models}
\usage{
screen_topics(x = NULL, remove_words = NULL, max_file_size)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An (optional) object of class \code{data.frame} or
\code{bibliography} to open in the browser. If empty, the app will launch
with no data. Data can be added within the app via the 'import' button.}

\item{remove_words}{Optional vector of words to be removed from
consideration by the Topic Model. If none are given, \code{screen_topics}
will use \code{\link{revwords}}. Note that this vector will be converted to
lower case before processing, so the algorithm is not case sensitive.}

\item{max_file_size}{Optional argument to set the maximum file size (in MB)
that the app will accept.}
}
\value{
This function launches a Shiny app in the users' default browser.

\description{
Screening is usually achieved by manually sorting titles or abstracts one at
a time. \code{screen_topics} offers an alternative by allowing the user to
group data by any column in the input dataset, and running a topic model on
the resulting data. This allows a great deal of flexibility to locate
patterns in journals, years, or authors, rather than just articles. Data
points can be selected or excluded individually, or by topic.
}
\details{
The display space is divided into three parts. From left to right, these are
the sidebar; the plot window; and the selection panel.

The sidebar shows a series of drop-down menus that can be used to customize
or recalculate the central plot. It can be hidden when not in use. Note that
the default settings for LDA (5 topics, 10,000 iterations) prioritize speed
over reliability - higher numbers of iterations will give more reliable
results.

The plot window shows an ordination of article weights calculated using LDA,
with articles colored by their highest-weighted topic. Hovering over a point
shows the title and abstract below the plot; clicking allows selection or
deselection of that article (and optionally displays co-authorship data).
Selecting a region of the plot and clicking zooms on the selected region;
double-clicking without selecting a region returns the plot to its full
extent.

The selection panel gives information on progress in including or excluding
articles. It also contains windows for displaying topic-level infromation
and article abstracts. All boxes in this panel can be minimized when not
required.

Ordinations are calculated using LDA (library \code{"topicmodels"}) and are
displayed using \code{shiny} and \code{plotly}.

When you have finished viewing/screening, you can export information to a
.csv or .rda file (saved to the working directory) using the 'Save' tab.
